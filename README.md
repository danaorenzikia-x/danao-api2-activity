o "Why did I choose to Embed the [Review/Tag/Log]?"
I chose to embed the review, tag, or log because I wanted the information to be self-contained and immediately accessible. By embedding it, I ensured that anyone reading my work wouldn’t need to search elsewhere for context—it’s all right there, tied directly to the content. This approach also helps me maintain accuracy and accountability, since the embedded details serve as a permanent record that can be traced back if needed. I find it more efficient to keep everything in one place, and it allows me to streamline the process of categorization or analysis later on.

o "Why did I choose to Reference the [Chef/User/Guest]?"
I chose to reference the chef, user, or guest because I wanted to highlight the human perspective behind the information. Referencing them adds credibility and personality, showing that the insights don’t just come from me but are grounded in real experiences or expertise. It also gives proper attribution, which I believe is important for fairness and transparency. By including their voices, I make the narrative richer and more relatable, since readers can connect with the authority of a chef, the authenticity of a user, or the impressions of a guest.
